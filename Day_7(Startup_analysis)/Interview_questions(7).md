## What is Ensemble Learning. Give an important example of Ensemble Learning?

- Ensemble Learning is a process of accumulating multiple models to form a better prediction model. In Ensemble Learning the performance of the individual model contributes to the overall development in every step. There are two common techniques in this – Bagging and Boosting.
- The most important example of Ensemble Learning is Random Forest Classifier. It takes multiple Decision Tree combined to form a better performance Random Forest model.

## What is Bagging?

-  In this the data set is split to perform parallel processing of models and results are accumulated based on performance to achieve better accuracy.
- Bagging method helps you to implement similar learners on small sample populations. It helps you to make nearer predictions.

## What is Boosting?

- This is a sequential technique in which a result from one model is passed to another model to reduce error at every step making it a better performance model.
- Boosting is an iterative method which allows you to adjust the weight of an observation depends upon the last classification. Boosting decreases the bias error and helps you to build strong predictive models.



## What is Imbalanced Data? How do you manage to balance the data?

- If a data is distributed across different categories and the distribution is highly imbalance. Such data are known as Imbalance Data. These kind of datasets causes error in model performance by making category with large values significant for the model resulting in an inaccurate model.

- There are various techniques to handle imbalance data. We can increase the number of samples for minority classes. We can decrease the number of samples for classes with extremely high numbers of data points. We can use a cluster based technique to increase number of Data points for all the categories.

## **Explain Unsupervised Clustering approach?**

Answer : Grouping the data into different clusters based on the distribution of data is known as Clustering technique.

There are various Clustering Techniques –

- Density Based Clustering – DBSCAN , HDBSCAN

- Hierarchical Clustering.

-  Partition Based Clustering

-  Distribution Based Clustering.

## **Explain Recommender Systems?**

- The goal of a recommender system is to generate meaningful recommendations to a collection of users for items or products that might interest them. 
- Suggestions for books on Amazon, or movies on Netflix, are real-world examples of the operation of industry-strength recommender systems. 
- The design of such recommendation engines depends on the domain and the particular characteristics of the data available. For example, movie watchers on Netflix frequently provide ratings on a scale of 1 (disliked) to 5 (liked). 
- Such a data source records the quality of interactions between users and items. Additionally, the system may have access to user-specific and item-specific profile attributes such as demographics and product descriptions, respectively.
